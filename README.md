Static website for bills and amendments.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Styling

- Research has shown that the ideal line length is about 65 characters. Anywhere between 45 and 85 is generally seen as acceptable, in the context of a roman alphabet. Reading is a complex process, and we should strive to make it as easy as possible. From [joshwcomeau's blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/)
